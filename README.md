 Project Overview
This is a fully hand-coded static website, built with:

🧱 HTML5 – clean, semantic structure

🎨 CSS3 – modern layout and styling


The goal is to show the entire process of developing a site from a blank file to a complete, styled result. The video features a chill, no-talking coding experience, perfect for background focus or inspiration.
